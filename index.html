	<h2>Who We Are</h2>
	<p>My name is Aimen Al-Doais and I am the founder and owner of Charlie & Pim's Kitty Cafe. Among the many things I love in life,
		two stand out the most - cats and coffee! Over the past couple years, I have taken up being a home barista as a hobby.
		I have practiced with a handful of recipes and am always looking for new recipes to try! <br>As for Charlie and Pim,
		those are my two-year-old twin Siamese cats whom I raised from the age of five weeks old. They are like my children and I would
		do anything to keep them happy and healthy. Not only are Charlie and Pim adorable and beautiful cats, but they are the most
		well-mannered that I have had. They are both used to having visitors and always behave respectfully. When they aren't napping,
		they love to chase and play with strings, get pet and brushed, and go on walks.</p>

	<h2>What We Offer</h2>
	<p>Here at Charlie & Pim's Kitty Kafe, <em>we offer great espresso-based beverages</em> and chill vibes in the comfort of our humble
		townhome! Whether you want to spend some time brushing Charlie's long, silky fur while sipping on a comforting hot lavender latte,
		take a cinnamon iced shaken espresso outside while you go for a walk so Pim can stop pawing at the door, or just want a simple
		Americano while you chat and study, Charlie & Pim's Kitty Kafe is the destination for you!</p>

	<h2>The CATch</h2>
	<p>The only catch when it comes to visiting Charlie & Pim's Kitty Kafe is that it is actually not a business at all. Because the
		Kitty Kafe is located in our home, and because I do not feel I have the barista experience to open for public business, it is
		only open to friends and family.</p>
