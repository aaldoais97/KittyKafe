			Every since moving to separate places, I have missed spending time with my brother and his cats everyday. Now that
			Charlie & Pim's Kitty Kafe is open, I've been spending so much time there watching TV and enjoying coffee and treats
			while Charlie sleeps on my lap.
		</p>
		<p>
			My favorite thing to order is the affogato. I just love gelato. Sometimes I just steal the tub of gelato out of the freezer!
			Sorry Aimen! Haha!

		<p>
			Latte art is a fun way to improve the presentation of a latte. With proper milk steaming to create the right texture,
			your latte is a blank canvas for any design you can think of! It may seem challenging, but many beautiful designs are
			very simple to make like this floral pattern. Once you've practiced enough, you can expand to more complex designs.
			There are also stencils and tools available online and in the kitchen section of some stores.
			<a href="https://a.co/d/c8TItwa">here is an example of what they look like.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The most important first step when learning to create latte art is to learn to steam milk to the perfect texture to create art.
			In today's blog post, I'll go over the steps that I follow to consistently get the right texture. It still doesn't come out
			perfect every time, but practice makes perfect!

		<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Purge your steam wand. Many steam wands spray liquid water for the first couple seconds, so it's important to get this liquid out.
			</li>
			<li>
				Angle the steam wand so that you can easily place it at the top-center of the milk jug and also submerge it to the bottom. Once
				you've done this, place the steam wand so that the tip just touches the surface of the milk and start steaming. Placing it at the
				surface will break the surface and allow air to be incorporated.
			</li>
			<li>
				Keep steaming with only the tip barely submerged until the milk reaches room temperature. At this point, fully submerge the wand
				and move the angle around until a swirling vortex is created by the jet of steam. Keep going until the jug is too hot to want to
				touch. This breaks down the bubbles into a silky microfoam.
			</li>
			<li>
				<em>Swirl the milk around and begin pouring your latte art!</em> Here's a helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiefJJv-Qho">beginner video</a>
				on pouring the art once you have your milk steamed to the right texture. Don't be discouraged if it takes many tries! It took me months to get
				the texture right on most attempts!
			</li>
